Client
======
This directory include an implementation for the client side service for "Freecycle-Inc". This is a front-end that communicate with the server to provide the desired services for the client. It has been implemented using Vue JavaScript framework

#### Usage
To run the client you would need the following commands

First make sure you are in the right directory
``` powershell
cd client
```
Hence we are using container we build and run the server as follow:
``` powershell
make build
```
``` powershell
make run
```
Having the client running on it's own wouldn't be useful as we need communicate with a server, to do that open new terminal and run the server. once you have the client open in a browser, point it to the server by placing the url for the server after the client one as follow:

``` powershell
clientUrl?api=serverUrl
```
// Update this link
``` powershell
https://8001-ca370-frameworksandla-lt146dhjlm1.ws-eu77.gitpod.io/?api=https://8000-ca370-frameworksandla-lt146dhjlm1.ws-eu77.gitpod.io
```
Now the app is ready to view and use.

#### Testing
For testing the client use the following command in the main directory

``` powershell
make test_client
```
it will use cypress test which produce a video for the test.
